# minimalist-collection

Having done a pretty broad evaluation of the current web app framework, library and tooling environment, I've come to the realization that most of what people are pushing right now is too complicated. Almost every article about tooling recently has some varriation on the the idea that "front end development is moving really fast." The thing is, it's not. Many of the interfaces people are building these days are no more complex than they were five or even ten years ago. So, while some folks really do need to spend a week setting up tooling and automation, most people shouldn't have to spend that much time to get up and running. 

That's where this project comes in. As I create them (for myself) I'm going to share out minimalist starter packs for different stacks. I'm not sure how useful any of these will be for anyone else, but they'll be useful for me, so that's enough reward for the effort.
